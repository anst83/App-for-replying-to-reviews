
### Step-by-Step Plan for Mood Checker App

#### 1. **Define the Purpose of the Application**

   - Create a desktop application that checks the user's mood based on their input.
   - Respond with emojis and messages that match the user's mood.
   - Include interactive Yes/No buttons to make the experience engaging.

#### 2. **Set Up the Project Structure**

   - **Create main Python file:** `my_app.py` – this will be the primary file where all the code resides.
   - **Organize assets folder:** Store emoji images (like `sad_emoji.png`, `happy_emoji.png`) and any icons you use in a folder called `assets/`.
   - **Create a README file:** Add documentation for setup, installation, and usage instructions.

#### 3. **Prepare Required Libraries**

   - **Tkinter**: For creating the GUI.
   - **Pillow**: To load and display emoji images in the interface.
   - **ttkbootstrap or customtkinter**: Optional, for styling the interface and creating rounded buttons and windows.

#### 4. **Build the Main Application Layout**

   - **Initialize main window**:
     - Set up the title, window size, and background color.
     - Make sure the main window is user-friendly with clear prompts.

   - **Create Input and Button Widgets**:
     - Add an `Entry` widget for the user to input their mood rating (1 to 10).
     - Add a `Submit` button to send the rating for evaluation.

#### 5. **Add Mood Evaluation Logic**

   - **Define mood categories based on the user's rating**:
     - Ratings 1–3: Display sad messages and emojis.
     - Ratings 4–6: Display neutral messages and emojis.
     - Ratings 7–10: Display happy messages and emojis.
   - **Implement response function**:
     - Check the rating input.
     - Based on the rating, call a function to display the corresponding message and emoji.

#### 6. **Design Message Display Function**

   - **Create a `display_message()` function**:
     - Accepts a title, message, and optional image path (for emojis).
     - Opens a new window to show the message and the emoji.
     - Use `Image.open()` from Pillow to load the emoji image and display it alongside the text.

#### 7. **Add Yes/No Options for Interactivity**

   - **Define `ask_question()` function**:
     - Opens a small window with a prompt and two buttons: Yes and No.
     - Triggers additional actions based on the user’s response (Yes/No).
   - **Style Yes/No Buttons**:
     - Add colors (e.g., green for Yes and red for No) and minimize spacing between buttons to enhance appearance.

#### 8. **Include Emoji Image Handling**

   - **Organize image paths**:
     - Ensure emoji images are stored in `assets/` and load them correctly using full or relative paths.
   - **Resize and display images**:
     - Use `Image.resize()` with `Image.LANCZOS` for quality, so the emojis fit well within the window.

#### 9. **Customize Styling and Appearance**

   - **Rounded buttons and frames**:
     - If using `customtkinter`, apply rounded corners and other stylistic options to buttons and frames.
   - **Theme and color adjustments**:
     - Experiment with colors, fonts, and button styles to make the interface visually appealing.

#### 10. **Test and Refine the Application**

   - **Test user interactions**:
     - Check that each mood rating triggers the correct emoji and message.
     - Ensure the Yes/No responses work as expected.
   - **Debug path and image loading issues**:
     - Verify that all image paths are correct, and that images display without errors.

#### 11. **Package the Application for Distribution**

   - Use **PyInstaller** to compile the program into an executable (.exe) for easy sharing.
   - Run the command with options like `--onefile` and `--windowed` for a clean single executable.

#### 12. **Write Documentation (README)**

   - Include setup instructions, usage steps, and details on each feature in a README file.
   - List any additional requirements or tips for troubleshooting.
